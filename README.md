## Estimating Dynamic Groundwater Vulnerability in the United States

### Landscape Response to Extreme Precipitation measured with SMAP

Within this repository are many tools that allow for utilizing SMAP data in R. In the scripts folder you will find work flows to convert hdf5 raw SMAP data into spatial data for use with analysis.

### Estimating Return Time of Soil Moisture

I am interested in predicting the amount of time it takes fro antecedent soil moisture conditions to return after a major rain event. This is an important indicator in vulnerability modeling, especially as it relates to groundwater contamination following extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones. You can explore the progress of my analysis [HERE](https://murraygeo.com/post/agu2020/agu2020_post/).

### Dashboards

Some of my work is presented in dashboards that are undergoing active development. You can see each dashboard by clicking on the interactive link below corresponding to each tropical cyclone that has made landfall in the southeastern United States since 2015
